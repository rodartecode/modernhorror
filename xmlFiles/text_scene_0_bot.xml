            <line>You’re standing in front of a window admiring the view when someone walks into the room behind you and interrupts your train of thought. You were deep in thought, but now you can’t remember what it was you were thinking about. In fact, now that you think about it, you can’t remember what you’re doing here. Or where you are. Or who you are. This can’t be good...</line>

            <line>A man speaks again — the same one who interrupted you — but you are still too distracted to hear what he said. A techie-looking guy is walking around the attic — that’s where you are! —  and looking around. He must have been speaking to someone down on the floor below. You realize that he is viewing the house with a realtor.</line>

            <line></line>You’re startled by the sound of another voice. You turn around to see an elderly woman who tells you that you shouldn’t be so easily startled for a ghost. After all, it’s you who should be learning to scare others. Or you could be friendly if you like — but you appear to have some type of unfinished business to deal with.</line>

            <line>You try to will the lights to flicker. As a ghost, you can do that, right? It almost seems like it worked slightly, but you can’t quite tell.</line>

            <line>She says she’s going to stay in the attic so she can finish her novel. Although she is forcing a smile as she says it, you get the impression that she’s read it a couple hundred times already. At least. You figure that you’d best go wander around and find something more interesting to do with your own afterlife.</line>
